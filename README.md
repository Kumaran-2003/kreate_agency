Kreate
🎨 Designer turned dev—this is my first React project.

🛠️ Built while learning React, just to see if I could.

🧠 UI/UX is my jam, but I wanted to try coding too.

What’s inside?
React + Vite setup

Clean, minimal UI

Responsive layout

Basic routing

No fancy backend—just frontend fun

Why I made this
I’m a designer, not a dev. But I wanted to understand how things work under the hood. So I built this from scratch while learning React. It’s not perfect, but it’s mine.
